<?php
//Modify your Heater class to define three new fields: min, max, and increment.
//The values of min and max should be set by parameters passed to the constructor.
//The value of increment should be set to 5 in the constructor.
//Modify the definitions of warmer and cooler so that they use the value of increment rather than an explicit value of 5.
//Before proceeding further, check that everything works as before.
//Now modify the warmer method so that it will not allow the temperature to be set to a value larger than max.
//Similarly modify cooler so that it will not allow temperature to be set to a value less than min.
//Check that the class works properly. Now add a method, setIncrement that takes a single integer parameter and uses it to set the value of increment.
//Once again, test that the class works as you would expect it to, 
//by creating some Heater objects. Do things still work as expected if a negative value is passed to the setIncrement method?
//Add a check to this method to prevent a negative value from being assigned to increment.
